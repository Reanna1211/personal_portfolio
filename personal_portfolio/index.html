            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Reanna, currently a psychological wellbeing practitioner looking to transition to a tech career.</p>
            <p>I have a keen interest in coding and building websites with front end and back end development. I also have an interest in data science and Machine Learning and love learning about AI.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy self teaching full stack engineer online courses and would like to eventually build an app with my skills. I also enjoy learning languages like Spanish and Korean as well as bachata and salsa dancing. I enjoy running and keeping fit</p>
